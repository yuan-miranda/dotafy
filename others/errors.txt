MUST: Account for dynamic changes of accounts, as they might disable their:
    Match history
    Delete server
    Unregister while the bot is fetching

SOLVED (i think):
    Match log messages being deleted
    Channel being deleted
    Would not log the error message when using /match on private registered users
    Innacurate heroes are being sent
    Bot doesnt send each players match result if theyre on the same team
    /register or any mention of getDota2IdBySteamId() or vice versa having non type int value will crash the bot
    Still not sure if auto /week and /month is working correctly
    Still using interval as a timer for auto standings
    Has no exit save data/clean up
    the formatStanding() might now be formatting correctly
    auto all command is useless, remove it

ISSUES:
Update game result image (dota like design)
Some outputs are not embeds
