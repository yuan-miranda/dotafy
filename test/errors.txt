Innacurate heroes are being sent
Would not log the error message when using /match on private registered users
MUST: Account for dynamic changes of accounts, as they might disable their:
    match history
    delete server
    unregister while the bot is fetching
SOLVED (i think):
    match log messages being deleted
    channel being deleted
Still using interval as a timer for auto standings
